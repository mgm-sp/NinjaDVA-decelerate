## Warning
:bangbang: This application purposely contains vulnerabilities. Use with caution!

## Description
This tool allows the audience to give feedback about the talking speed of a presenter.
Additionally, it serves as a demo application with vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerabilities
* JSON Web Tokens with signing algorithm `none` get accepted
* JWT Payload contains type information which is not validated before deserializing it

## Todo List
* add WebSocket vulnerability, maybe to get average and still poll the individual users
* make JWT vulnerability a bit less obvious, maybe using switch-case for the algorithms
